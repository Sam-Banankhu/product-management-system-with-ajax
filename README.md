# Web Mini Project

Create a web application that allows users to manage products, search for products, and display them in tables.

## Requirements

- **Product Form:** Design a form where users can add new products. Include fields for product name, description, price, and quantity.

- **Product Listing:** Display the list of products in a table format, showing relevant details such as product name, price, and quantity available.

- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature that allows users to search for products based on different criteria such as name, price range, or category. Display the search results dynamically without page refresh.

- **Edit and Delete Functionality:** Provide options to edit and delete existing products. Allow users to modify product details or remove products from the list.

- **Data Persistence:** Store the product data in a database to ensure data persistence. You can use a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to create a product table and perform CRUD operations.

- **Validation:** Implement form validation to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly before adding or editing products. Validate input data to prevent any potential errors or inconsistencies.

- **Responsive Design:** Create a responsive and visually appealing user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) to ensure optimal display on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to users in case of any issues during data processing or user interactions.
